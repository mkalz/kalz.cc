Since many years I am using at least one external monitor for work and it has supported my productivity a lot. During an intensive time of online-meetings and online-teaching in the last 3 years I have extended my setup with another external screen so that I have three screens available. On a normal working day I am switching many windows from and between these screens and sometimes I am also disconnecting my machine (a Macbook Air M1) completely from the setup. This means a lot of shuffling and moving of application-windows between the screens. For this purpose I have bought a version of StreamDeck to see if it is possible to define scenarios which allow to automate the switching between different productivity modes easily with an external button.

**My setup for the use of three monitors**

I could now finally realize this scenario with a relatively easy set of ingredients after a lot of trail-and-error and I would like to share the setup here:

  1. Elgato Stream Deck MK.2 â€“ [Studio-Controller with 15 buttons](https://www.elgato.com/de/stream-deck)
  2. A small application called [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) which costs around 12 EUR 
  3. The [Moom profile activator for Stream Deck](https://github.com/magobaol/streamdeck-moom)

After installing all applications including the Stream Deck software for defining the functions of the buttons, I have ordered in Moom now the windows in the different screens according to productivity scenarios: A scenario for teaching and presenting online, a scenario for writing, a scenario for information aquisition and so on. In Moom it is very easy to save these scenarion. After all windows have been positioned, I can just chose "Save Windows Layout Snapshot" and the settings are stored. In the Stream Deck software I can now select the "Moom profile activator" and shift it to one of the buttons. After selecting now the required profile and naming the button accordingly, I can switch and position all application windows with a click of a single button. As a nice extra functionality, Moom allows me also to ignore the windows in the background and to select a standard scenario depending in how many external monitors are connected.
