abstract="This study focuses on identifying the barriers to satisfaction of MOOC participants, and the predictors of these barriers. Five hundred and forty-two English as a Second Language MOOC participants responded to pre- and post-questionnaires. Using exploratory factor analysis three kinds of barriers were identified, namely: `Lack of interestingness/relevance', `Lack of time/bad planning' and `Lack of knowledge/technical problem'. The effects of the participant's age, gender and level of self-efficacy, motivation, self-regulation learning skills and the intention to complete the course were analyzed as predictors of those barriers. Theoretical and practical implications regarding online learner satisfaction are discussed.",
