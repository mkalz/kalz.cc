abstract: "This explorative study aimed to get an understanding of MOOC-success as seen from the perspective of the MOOC-taker and the types of barriers which might stand in the way of this success. Data of two MOOCs was used to illustrate MOOC-success from two perspectives and barriers encountered. Fol-lowing the currently used approach to identify educational success, the success rate of MOOC-II was 5,6%. The success rates from the perspective of the MOOC-taker was 70%. In addition, data of MOOC-I and II showed that the en-countered barriers were mainly non-MOOC-related. Workplace issues and lack of time were most frequently indicated. For MOOC-designers’ decision making regarding redesign of a MOOC after evaluation, it is valuable to have insight in these matters to prevent unnecessary design interventions. "
