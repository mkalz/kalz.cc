abstract: "Providing and receiving feedback requires a certain openness in individuals which is referred to as feedback orientation. Although this openness is also required in peer-feedback processes personal factors that influence student’s openness (i.e. peer-feedback orientation) are less researched. Inspired by feedback orientation studies in a workplace setting we investigated personal factors that influence students’ peer-feedback orientation. As part of an exploratory sequential mixed methods research design, qualitative data on personal factors influencing student’s peer-feedback orientation was collected. Semi-structured interviews with students, teachers and researchers (N = 13) revealed a broad range of personal factors influencing their peer-feedback orientation. Thematic analyses of the data showed that the most prominent factors were related to the perceived usefulness of receiving and providing peer-feedback, the social bond between students, fairness and skills. The importance of existing feedback orientation dimensions (utility, accountability, social awareness and self-efficacy) by (Linderbaum and Levy, Journal of Management 36:1372–1405, 2010) was confirmed in a higher education setting. Interestingly, different interpretations of the dimensions were found which should lead to the development of a peer-feedback orientation scale for higher education."
