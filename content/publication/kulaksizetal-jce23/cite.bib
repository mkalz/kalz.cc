	abstract = {As cancer continues to be a significant global health challenge, the education of oncology professionals plays a crucial role in providing quality cancer care and achieving optimal patient outcomes. In order to meet the growing need for flexible, accessible, and effective training, this study examines the role of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) in the education of oncology medical professionals. Following the PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review included 34 articles published between 2012 and 2022 in EBSCO and PubMed databases. Findings reveal a diverse range of digital tools being used in oncology training, despite a shortage of advanced educational technologies and limited functional improvement compared to traditional instruction. Since the training primarily targeted at multiple professions in the medical expert role, with radiation oncologists being overrepresented, other oncology domains should be examined more thoroughly in the future, taking into account distinct professional abilities, e.g. communication, collaboration, and leadership skills with reference to the CanMEDS framework. Although the training programmes generally resulted in positive outcomes according to the Kirkpatrick evaluation model, experimental research designs were rather limited. Therefore, the substantial contribution and limitations of TEL in oncology education need to be clarified. Precise reporting of digital tools and instructional processes, as well as challenges encountered, is highly recommended to increase transparency and replicability. Research methodology in digital oncology education remains a major concern and should be addressed accordingly in future research.},
