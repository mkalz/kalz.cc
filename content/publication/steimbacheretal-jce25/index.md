abstract: "Considering the increasing relevance of digital education in cancer training, this study explores the current use of educational technologies in oncology across Europe. A cross-sectional study was conducted using convenience sampling to gather responses from learners and educators across Europe. Data was collected online via Lime Survey. Results indicate that both groups are most familiar with synchronous and blended learning, with less experience in asynchronous and hybrid formats. Live lectures were the most used tool, while virtual reality and simulations were less used. Regional differences reveal that Northern Europe prefers audio-based tools and e-books, while Central Europe demonstrates higher familiarity with asynchronous learning and interactive tools. Southern Europe has less experience with various modalities and tools. Professionally, cancer nurses reported more experience with asynchronous learning and learning management systems, while clinical oncologists demonstrated limited familiarity with various tools, particularly emerging technologies. For multi-disciplinary oncology training to succeed, practitioners need to align learning objectives with participants’ prior experiences and balance diverse target groups and implementation needs to address regional and professional disparities. Targeted efforts are needed to bridge gaps in digital infrastructure, accessibility, and institutional support. Explanatory studies are needed to confirm these findings."
