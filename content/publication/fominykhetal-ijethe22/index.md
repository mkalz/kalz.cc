abstract: "This research revealed the antecedes of two learner-centered outcome measures of success in massive open online courses (MOOCs): learner satisfaction and learner intention-fulfillment. Previous studies used success criteria from formal education contexts placing retention and completion rates as the ultimate outcome measures. We argue that the suggested learner-centered outcomes are more appropriate for measuring success in non-formal lifelong learning settings because they are focused on the learner’s intentions, rather than the intentions of the course developer. The behavioural measures of 125 MOOC participants who answered a pre- and a post-questionnaire were harvested. The analysis revealed that learner satisfaction was directly affected by: the importance of the MOOC’s benefits; online self-regulated learning - goal setting; number of video lectures accessed; and, perceived course usability. Age and the number of quizzes accessed indirectly effected learner satisfaction, through perceived course usability and through number of video lectures accessed. Intention-fulfillment was directly affected by: gender; the importance of the MOOC’s benefits; online self-regulated learning - goal setting; the number of quizzes accessed; the duration of participation; and, perceived course usability. Previous experience with MOOCs and the importance of MOOC’s benefits, indirectly affected intention-fulfillment through the number of quizzes accessed and perceived course usability."
