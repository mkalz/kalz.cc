summary:
abstract: The integration of digital skills and media education is considered as a challenge for curriculum development and teaching practice of teacher education. In Germany, approximately 30% of the teacher education programs have not yet introduced a mandatory module on digital skills. Furthermore, these modules hardly can cope with the complexity of technology-enhanced learning and the diverse decision-making moments when introducing digital tools and teaching practices in classroom instruction. Recent developments in artificial intelligence and natural language processing are considered another wave of disruption regarding the skill development of teachers with regard to digital literacy. The talk will deal with different dimensions of the wide-spread access to AI tools for learning and teaching purposes and its implications for digital literacy of teachers and will highlight some research challenges.
