summary: 
abstract: "The field of open education has its roots in distance education and has developed over the years specific types of activities namely the publication of Open Educational Resources (OER) and the development of massive open online courses (MOOCs). While more and more higher education institutions are opening up their educational offer for learners outside of the institution, organisational implications of these activities are not well researched. In this talk I will provide an overview about the challenges and opportunities of open education and I will build a connection to related fields like open access and open science."
